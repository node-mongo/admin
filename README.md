NodeMongoAdmin is a Web-based MongoDb management console, written in Node JS and Vue JS.
The familiar interface allows you to manage many different aspects of your MongoDB installation:

- MongoDB installation status and overview.
- Databases overview.
- User(s) authentication and authorization.
- Collections and objects management.
- Importing and exporting data.
- Processing overview.
- Administration tools.

NodeMongoAdmin is accessible, easy to setup, easy to learn and provides plenty of tools required for day to day MongoDB management.

## Learning MongoDB

NodeMongoAdmin provides full [documentation](https://phpmongoadmin.com/support/documentation) along with some video tutorials, making it a breeze to get started with the management interface.

If you've used other tools like PhpMyAdmin, the old RockMongo application or even our PhpMongoAdmin App then you'll find NodeMongoAdmin to be very familiar.

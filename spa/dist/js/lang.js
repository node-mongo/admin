Here at Node Mongo Admin we have a few fundamental principles:","intro2":"<ul><li>We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)<\/li><li>We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.<\/li><li>We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.<\/li><li>In our classifieds products, we aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what’s visible to the public, seen by search engines, kept private, and permanently deleted.<\/li><\/ul>","p1":"Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals: (Note, this privacy policy is available under a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-sa\/4.0\/\">Creative Commons Sharealike<\/a> license, which means you’re more than welcome to steal it and repurpose it for your own use, just make sure to replace references to us with ones to you, and if you want we’d appreciate a link to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.adultmuse.com\/\">adultmuse.com<\/a> somewhere on your site.)","p2":"If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data or if you are having difficulty with a function of the members area please contact our <a href=\"\/#\/contact-us\">support team<\/a>","t3":"Website Visitors","p3":"Like most website operators, Node Mongo Admin collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Node Mongo Admins` purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Node Mongo Admins` visitors use its website. From time to time, Node Mongo Admin may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.","p4":"Node Mongo Admin also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users that are searching for and browsing 'Ads'. Node Mongo Admin only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that a blog commenter and Ad posters IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog or classifieds where the comment or 'Ad' was left.","t5":"Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information","p5":"Certain visitors to Node Mongo Admins` websites choose to interact with Node Mongo Admin in ways that require Node Mongo Admin to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Node Mongo Admin gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for an 'Ads' account to provide a Name and Email address. Those who engage in transactions with Node Mongo Admin – by purchasing 'Ad Booster' products for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions, however, we will never directly ask any customer for Credit-Card details as we use external payment gateways such as PayPal. In each case, Node Mongo Admin collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Node Mongo Admin. Node Mongo Admin does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. Any visitor(s) can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.","t6":"Aggregated Statistics","p6":"Node Mongo Admin may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Node Mongo Admin may monitor the most popular 'Ads' on the <a href=\"\/#\/latest\">Lastest Ads<\/a> page or use information logged during 'searches' to better understand website usage trends. Node Mongo Admin may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Node Mongo Admin does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.","t7":"Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information","p7":"Node Mongo Admin discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Node Mongo Admins` behalf or to provide services available at Node Mongo Admins` websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Node Mongo Admins` websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Node Mongo Admin will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Node Mongo Admin discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Node Mongo Admin believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Node Mongo Admin, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user or member of an Node Mongo Admin website and have supplied your email address, Node Mongo Admin may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Node Mongo Admin and our classifieds products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Node Mongo Admin takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifiable information.","t8":"Cookies","p8":"A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Node Mongo Admin uses cookies to help Node Mongo Admin identify and track visitors, their usage of Node Mongo Admin website, and their website access preferences. Node Mongo Admin visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Node Mongo Admins` websites, with the drawback that certain features of Node Mongo Admin websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.","t9":"Business Transfers","p9":"If Node Mongo Admin, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Node Mongo Admin goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Node Mongo Admin may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.","t10":"External Ads","p10":"External Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Node Mongo Admin and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.","t11":"Classified Ads","p11":"Ads placed by registered users or members remain the Copyrighted &copy; property of said user or member up until the time they remove their ads from our database.
